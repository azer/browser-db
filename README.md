## db

Database library of Kaktus. It consists of following IndexedDB storages;

* [Buffers](#buffers)
* [Positions](#positions)
* [History](#history)
* [Likes](#likes)
* [Domains](#domains)
* [Meta](#meta)
* [Keywords](#keywords)
* [Downloads](#downloads)
* [Screenshots](#screenshots)
* [Icons](#icons)
* [Files](#files)

Here is some quick bulletpoints about how this DB interacts with Kaktus:

* Kaktus window manager gives each window an ID, passes it to the window.
* Window displays are represented as one or multiple positions. Each position shows one buffer.
* When user opens the browser for first time, Kaktus creates the default position (single-full) with an empty buffer (displayed as new tab UI)
* When user types a URL to go, current focused position's buffer updates its URL attribute. Every URL visited will be saved to history.
* Once a page is loaded, Kaktus will extract meta and keywords from the page and save it to the DB.

## Install

```bash
$ npm install kaktus/db
```

## First Steps

A web browsing session starts with showing the buffer(s) of the current session. Here is how we program that;

```js
const db = require('db')

// Grab all the positions
db.positions.all((error, row) => {
  if (error) throw error

  row.value.width
  // => 100%

  row.value.height
  // => 100%

  db.buffers.get(row.value, (error, buffer) => {
    if (error) throw error

    buffer.url
    // => lonelyplanet.com
  })
})
```
